# MNIST-Dataset-CNN-Practice
This is the code for the Convolution Neural Network, I wrote for the MNIST dataset. The dataset is loaded from torchvision. The maximum accuracy I got in this code was 97%. Probably increasing the momentum would make the model converge fast in the same number of epochs.
